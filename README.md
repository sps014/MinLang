# Syntax Expression Tree
It is a Recursive Descent Parser. It is a kind of Top-Down Parser. A top-down parser builds the parse tree from the top to down, starting with the start non-terminal. A Predictive Parser is a special case of Recursive Descent Parser, where no Back Tracking is required.

It provide  Base or foundation for writing compilers, Left Recursion Free CFG can be handled by this and custom facilities can be added by Extending `Lexer` , `Parser` and `Bound Tree`. 


### Steps to Build
1. Install Rust Language Compiler, if not already installed.
2. Clone the Repo.
3. Go to repo and run following command in terminal
```
